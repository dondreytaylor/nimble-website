                <p><strong>For Full Refunds.</strong> In order to obtain a full refund, you must initiate a Product return by contacting us via email which can be found at https://nimblenode.io/support, provided such return request is initiated within fifteen (15) days upon the delivery of the product to you. In order to qualify for a full refund, the product(s) must be returned unused and sealed in the original package with all original materials provided in their complete condition. We will issue a full refund of your order minus the original shipping charges and your return shipping fees. For refund of the product(s) obtained through Bitcoin payments please read “Returns of Merchandise” below. You are also entitled to receive a full refund if you cancel your order before your item was confirmed as Shipped.</p>
                <p><strong>For Partial Refunds.</strong> We inspect all returned items when they arrive at our service processing facility. If you do not qualify for a full refund, we may grant you a partial refund for unsealed or used products. In order to qualify for a partial return you must initiate a Product return by contacting us via email which can be found at https://nimblenode.io/support within fifteen (15) days upon the delivery of the product. We will issue a partial refund minus the original shipping charges and return shipping fees and our return processing costs (typically consisting of inspection costs, refurbishing and repackaging costs charged by our return processing facility or additional return processing costs that might occur to us). For refund of the product(s) obtained through Bitcoin payments please read “Returns of Merchandise” below.</p>
                <p><strong>Defective Product and Returns Due to Product Error.</strong> If the item you ordered is damaged or defective at the time of its receipt you may return it in order to get a replacement of the product. Such return must be initiated within fifteen (15) days upon the receipt of the product. Replacement order will be shipped when the original item is received and processed at our service processing facility. If the returned product is not defective, return shipping fees will be charged to you. If your item is defective due to product error (not including “Ineligible Products” as defined under an applicable warranty) after fifteen (15) days upon the receipt of the product, you may return it for a repair or replacement within the warranty period and under the terms of the warranty, but no later than without undue delay upon the reveal of the product‘s defect. A repaired product or replacement order will be shipped when the original item is received and processed at our service processing facility. If our service processing facility concludes from inspection that the returned product is either (i) not defective or (ii) is an “Ineligible Product” as defined under an applicable warranty, the costs for returning the product shall be carried out by the product owner. In such event and at our sole discretion, we might offer to the product owner a discount on a new product purchase as a compensation for not returning the item to the product owner. </p>
                <p><strong>Refund Credit.</strong> The refund will be executed within four (4) weeks upon the day we receive the returned product. In most cases you will receive the refund sooner, but we estimate four weeks because of the time required for product inspection at our returns facility (up to 5 business days), and processing of the payment in Bitcoin (5 business days) or with your bank or credit card company (up to 10 business days). Once your credit is prepared, we will ask you for the details of your refund address or account. All refunds are issued by the method of payment used by you in order to pay for the product. Once your return is processed we will send you a confirmation email.</p>
                <p><strong>Returns of Merchandise.</strong> Canceled orders or returned merchandise that qualify for a full or partial refund will be refunded to the customer (a) using the same payment method used by customer for the original purchase, and (b) in the same currency and amount that customer paid for the original purchase. To illustrate the foregoing, if a customer originally purchases a product for 1 Bitcoin, and is due a full refund for such product under this Return Policy, that customer will receive a refund of 1 Bitcoin for such product, regardless of the currency exchange rate for such Bitcoin at the time of the original purchase. Bitcoin refunds will be processed to a Bitcoin address provided by you to our Support Center during the return process. Credit card or debit card refunds will be refunded with the appropriate amount in U.S. Dollars to the cardholder‘s account. Unlike traditional banking transfer, Bitcoin transactions are not revertible and a refund of an incorrectly transmitted payment cannot be enforced. Please note that you are fully responsible for the correctness of the provided Bitcoin address and that you hereby agree that you bear any consequences and financial loss incurred from providing incorrect payment instructions to our service processing facility.</p>
